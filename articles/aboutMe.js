    Prior to working as a software engineer I used to work as croupier in two
    Maltese casinos. Dealing games such as roulette, blackjack and at later
    stages Texas hold 'em poker too. After 4 years, at the age of 22, I
    realized that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I was
    asking myself what new profession I could start if I had to stop working
    as croupier.

    Being my extended family's uncertified but effective PC technician, I did
    know the basics of computers by around the age of 12. I knew what RAM, CPU
    and hard disk were and why a¬†computer may be performing slow. I also knew
    that if your Ethernet cable was unplugged that is very likely the be the
    reason for not having internet connection. Ohh, and I certainly knew how to
    format hard disks! That was my solution to PCs with janky performance
    problems. It worked most of the time. When it didn't, I told my clients to
    go to a real technician.üòÅ

    Back to me being a croupier and wanting to change my profession - I always
    loved computers. I had fallen in love with computers when my family bought
    a home PC in 2002. My love for computers grew even stronger in my late
    teenage when I was assembling gaming computer hardware for myself and
    friends. The idea of me working as an IT professional was intriguing. I
    started to look in which field I could work as an IT professional. Do I
    become the certified PC technician that I never was? ü§î Or perhaps should
    I look at other jobs in IT? What if I become a programmer? but how
    exactly? These were the questions that I was asking to myself and that was
    the time when I started to be curious about software. Java was the first
    programming languages I came across with. I remember being very excited
    after (long time) I managed successfully execute a hello world app on my
    machine. Then I took it further. In few weeks I built several
    micro-applications which runs via the terminal. Then I came across HTML
    and CSS. I found these two much easier and in few days I had built an
    amateur website for a fictitious restaurant and it's menu was full of food
    which I was cooking at home at that time. I was taking photos after each
    cooked meal to use them on my experimental web project.‚ò∫Ô∏è By this time I
    was sure that I want to be a software engineer. The question was no longer
    in which field I can work in IT. The question was what programming
    language I should focus on. At that time I had chosen Java.

    Background color, italic fonts and anchor tags which links to internal
    pages. This is part of what I built days after I heard with "HTML" and
    "CSS". Despite knowing it was basic and also very different than
    professional websites I was still over the moon with my achievements.

    Using the image tag was another milestone that I reached on the same
    day. üéâ

    In 2012 I started to read for an International diploma in computing. After
    graduating I started reading for BSc. Computer Science(System Engineering)
    in 2013. The degree focused more on system engineering than the
    fundamentals of computer science but at that time I believed it was
    sufficient¬†to land me my dream job at the time - working as a Java
    developer.

  <p>
    While studying for a bachelor degree, at the end of the year 2014 I was
    offered a working opportunity as a full stack developer. Working with PHP
    and frontend technologies. It wasn't exactly my ambition to work as a
    software developer if I wasn't going to use Java as a programming language
    but I saw this as a great opportunity to start with and I accepted the
    offer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fast forwarding to today - I have never looked back. I've spent an amazing
    6 years working as a professional fullstack developer. It has been an
    amazing journey and the ever-changing technologies related to web
    applications fascinates me.
