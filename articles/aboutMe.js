  <p>My full name is Matthew Barbara. For the last ${workingExperience} I've been working as a fullstack developer. My hobbies are skiing, hiking, gym, playing video games and learning more about software development. I was born and raised in Malta and I've been living in Switzerland since 2018.</p>
  <p>
    Prior to working as a software engineer, I used to work as a croupier in two casinos in Malta. Dealing games such as roulette, blackjack and at later stages, Texas hold 'em poker too. After four years, aged 22, I realised that this isn‚Äôt what I want to do for the rest of my life. I found myself asking what new profession I could take on if I had to stop working as a croupier.

    Being my extended family's uncertified but effective PC technician, I did know the basics of computers by around the time I was 12 years old. I knew what RAM, CPU and hard disk were and why a computer may be performing slow. I also knew if your Ethernet cable was unplugged, it might be the reason why you have no internet connection. Ohh, and I certainly knew how to format hard disks! That was my solution to PCs with janky performance problems. It worked most of the time. When it didn't, I told my clients to go to a real technician.üòÅ

    Back to me being a croupier and wanting to change my profession - I always loved computers. I had fallen in love with computers when my family bought a home PC in 2002. My passion for computers grew even more in my late teens when I assembled gaming computer hardware for myself and my friends. The idea of me working as an IT professional was intriguing. I started to look in which field I could work as an IT professional. Do I become the certified PC technician that I never was? ü§î Or perhaps should I look at other jobs in IT? What if I become a programmer? But how exactly? These were the questions that I was asking myself and that was when I started to become curious about software.

    Java was the first programming language I came across with. I remember being very excited after (a long time) I successfully executed a hello world app on my machine. Then I took it further. In few weeks, I built several micro-applications which runs via the terminal. Then I came across HTML and CSS. I found these two easier to deal wih and in a few days, I had built an amateur website for a fictitious restaurant, and it's menu was full of food that I was cooking at home at that time. I was taking photos of each meal I cooked to use them on my experimental web project.‚ò∫Ô∏è By this time, I was sure that I wanted to be a software engineer. The question was no longer in which field I can work in IT. The question was what programming language I should focus on. At that time, I had chosen Java.

        And of course, I learned how to load images too. üéâ

    In 2012 I began studying to get an International diploma in computing. After graduating, in 2013,  I started studying for BSc. Computer Science(System Engineering). The degree focused more on system engineering rather than the fundamentals of computer science. However, I believed it was sufficient to land me my dream job at the time - working as a Java developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    While studying for a bachelor degree, at the end of the year 2014, I was offered a job opportunity as a full stack developer. There I was working with PHP and frontend technologies. It wasn't precisely my ambition to work as a software developer if I wasn't going to use Java as a programming language but I have, nevertheless, saw this as a great opportunity to start with and I accepted the offer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fast-forwarding to today - I have never looked back. I've spent an incredible six years working as a professional full stack developer. It has been an amazing journey and the ever-changing technologies related to web applications fascinates me.
