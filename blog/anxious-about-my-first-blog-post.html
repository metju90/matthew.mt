      <h1>Anxious about my first blog post</h1>
      <small>April 17th, 2020</small>
      <p>
        At the end of October 2018 when React hooks were introduced by the
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-QO-KO90iQ&list=PLPxbbTqCLbGE5AihOSExAa4wUM-P42EIJ"
          target="_blank"
          >core team
        </a>
        I wasted no time to start experimenting with them. It was the newest and
        hottest topic for the months to come in the React community.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember that I wanted to be one of the first to share my personal
        experience in using React hooks. Writing a trivial application with
        React hooks is entirely different process than writing the same
        application in React classes. After some time using hooks, it felt much
        easier to work with and for the first time since I started to work in
        this industry I felt that I could write a blog post about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was very anxious about the idea. In my late teenage and early 20s I
        was the team-lead of a semi-professional e-sport team (playing
        competitive videos games) which dominated the Maltese e-sport scene and
        used to compete in the top tier in Europe. When my
        <a
          href="https://eversio.org/achievements?year=All%20Years&game=All%20Games&player=Metju"
          >successful career </a
        >in e-sport was coming to an end I wanted to share my experience with
        the community. I knew there were many teenagers investing countless
        amount of hours to reach the top tier and win competitions. I wanted to
        share with them my path to success. The strategies I implemented, how
        valuable team-work is and all the dos and don'ts. At the peak of the
        said career I was playing video games for around 60-80 hours per week.
        Yes, you read right. between 60 to 80 hours per week. I ended up writing
        a biography.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, that biography was written in my native language. If I had to
        write a technical post it would be in English. But English is not my
        native language and it is an ongoing process to write with minimal or no
        mistakes at all. What if I expose my imperfections? What would my
        colleagues think about me sharing my thoughts in a blog? I don't think
        they ever did this anyway. All of these negative thoughts coupled with
        the effort I had to put to set up a blog in the limited time I had
        available made me let this idea go away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, a year and a half later, I've managed to overcome this fear and I
        managed to write my first blog post about the first blog post which
        didn't happen! <span class="emoji">&#x1f973; &#x1f389; &#x1f38a;</span>
