      <h1>Anxiety in writing my first blog post</h1>

      <p>
        At the end of October 2018 when React hooks were introduced to the world
        by the core team in
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-QO-KO90iQ&list=PLPxbbTqCLbGE5AihOSExAa4wUM-P42EIJ"
          target="_blank"
          >React conf</a
        >
        I wasted no time to start experimenting with them. It was the newest and
        hottest topic for the months to come in the React community.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember that I wanted to be one of the first to share my personal
        experience in using React hooks. Writing a trivial application with
        React hooks is entirely different process than writing the same
        application in React classes. After getting used to hooks, it felt much
        easier and fun to work with and for the first time since I started to
        work in this industry I felt that I could write a blog post about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was very anxious about the idea. In my early twenties when my
        <a
          href="https://eversio.org/achievements?year=All%20Years&game=All%20Games&player=Metju"
          >gold decorated career</a
        >

        in gaming (e-sports, competitive video games) was coming to an end I
        wanted to share my experience with the community. I knew there were many
        teenagers investing countless amount of hours to reach the top tier and
        win competitions. I wanted to share with them my path to success. What
        my life consisted of being a semi-pro gamer, all the tricks, all the
        do's and don'ts. At the peak of the said career I was playing video
        games for around 60-80 hours per week. I ended up writing a lengthy
        biography.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, that biography was written in my native language. If I had to
        write a technical post it would be in English. But English is not my
        native language and it is an on-going process to write with minimal or
        no mistakes at all. What if I expose my imperfections? What would my
        colleagues think about me sharing my thoughts in a blog? I don't think
        they ever did this anyway. All of these negative thoughts coupled with
        the effort I had to put to set up a blog in the limited time I had
        available made me let this idea go away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, year and a half later, i've managed to overcome this fear and I
        managed to write my first blog post about the first blog post itself!
