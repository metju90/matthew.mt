Hello 

I am a software developer working mainly on web-related projects. My hobbies are
skiing, gym, binging on Netflix. I am coming from a tiny island in the middle of the
Mediterranean sea Malta and I living in Switzerland. On this site I plan to start
writing occasional blog posts and in the future also share cool projects I worked on.
