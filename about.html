      Prior to working as a software engineer I used to work as croupier in two
      Maltese casinos. Dealing games such as roulette, blackjack and at later
      stages Texas hold 'em poker too. After 4 years, at the age of 22, I
      realized that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I was
      asking myself what new profession I could start if I had to stop working
      as croupier.

      Being my extended family's uncertified but effective PC technician, I did
      knew the basics of computers by around the age of 12. I knew what RAM, CPU
      and hard disk were and why aÂ computer may be performing slow. I also knew
      that if your Ethernet cable was unplugged that is very likely the be the
      reason for not internet connection. Ohh, and I certainly knew how to
      format hard disks! That was my solution to PCs with janky performance
      problems. It worked most of the time. When it didn't, I told my clients to
      go to a real technician

      Back to me being a croupier and wanting to change my profession - I always
      loved computers. I had fallen in love with computers when my family bought
      a home PC in 2002. My love for computers grew even stronger in my late
      teenage when I was assembling gaming computer hardware for myself and
      friends. The idea of me working as an IT professional was intriguing. I
      started to look in which field I could work as an IT professional. Do I
      become the certified PC technician that I never was ðŸ¤”? Or perhaps should
      I look at other jobs in IT? What if I become a programmer? but how
      exactly? These were the questions that I was asking to myself and that was
      the time when I started to be curious about software. Java was the first
      programming languages I came across with. I remember being very excited
      after (long time) I managed successfully execute a hello world app on my
      machine. Then I took it further. In few weeks I built several
      micro-applications which runs via the terminal. Then I came across HTML
      and CSS. I found these two much easier and in few days I had built an
      amateur website - I created a website for a fictitious restaurant and it's
      menu was full of food which I was cooking at home at that time, including
      photos of the meals! I was doing something new and I was loving it! By
      this time I was sure that I want to be a software engineer.

        Background color, italic fonts and anchor tags which links to internal
        pages. This is part of what I built days after I heard with "HTML" and
        "CSS". Despite knowing it was basic and also very different than
        professional websites I was still over the moon with my achievements.

        Using the image tag was another milestone that I reached on the same
        day. ðŸŽ‰

      In 2012 I started to read for an International diploma in computing. After
      graduating I started reading for BSc. Computer Science(System Engineering)
      in 2013. The degree focused more on system engineering than the
      fundamentals of computer science but at that time I believed it was
      sufficientÂ to land me my dream job at the time - working as a Java
      developer.

      While studying for a bachelor degree, at the end of the year 2014 I was
      offered a working opportunity as a full stack developer. Working with PHP
      and frontend technologies. It wasn't exactly my ambition to work as a
      software developer if I wasn't going to use Java as a programming language
      but I saw this as a great opportunity to start with and I accepted the
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast forwarding to today - I have never looked back. I've spent an amazing
      6 years working as a professional fullstack developer. It has been an
      amazing journey and the ever-changing technologies related to web
      applications fascinates me.
