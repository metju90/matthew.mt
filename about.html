      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Prior to working as a software engineer I used to work as croupier in
        two Maltese casinos. Dealing games such as roulette, blackjack and at
        later stages Texas hold 'em poker too. After 4 years, at the age of 22,
        I realized that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I
        was asking myself what new profession I could start if I had to stop
        working as croupier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being my extended family's uncertified but effective PC technician, I
        did knew the basics of computers by around the age of 12. I knew what
        RAM, CPU and hard disk were and why a computer may be performing slow. I
        also knew that if your Ethernet cable was unplugged that may be the
        reason for not having internet connection. I could also setup printers
        on PCs. Ohh, and I certainly knew how to format hard disks! That was my
        solution to PCs with janky performance problems. It worked most of the
        time. When it didn't, I told my clients to go to a real technician
        <span class="emoji">&#x1f62c;</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to me being a croupier and wanting to change my profession - I
        always loved computers. I had fallen in love with computers when my
        family bought a home PC in 2002. My love for computers grew even
        stronger in my late teenage when I was assembling gaming computer
        hardware for myself and friends. The idea of me working as an IT
        professional was intriguing. I started to look in which field I could
        work as an IT professional. Do I become the certified PC technician that
        I never was? Or perhaps should I look at other jobs in IT? What if I
        become a programmer? but how exactly? That was the time when I started
        to be curious about software. Java was the first programming languages I
        came across with. I found a tutorial on how to build a hello world
        application and fell in love with it. I got excited. I was doing
        something new and I was loving it!
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012 I started to read for an International diploma in computing.
        After graduating I started reading for BSc. Computer Science(System
        Engineering) in 2013. The degree focused more on system engineering than
        the fundamentals of computer science but at that time I believed it was
        sufficient to land me my dream job at the time - working as a Java
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        While studying for a bachelor degree, at the end of the year 2014 I was
        offered a working opportunity as a full stack developer. Working with
        PHP and frontend technologies. It wasn't exactly my ambition to work as
        a software developer if I wasn't going to use Java as a programming
        language but I saw this as a great opportunity to start with and I
        accepted the offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forwarding to today - I never looked back. I've spent an amazing 6
        years working as a professional fullstack developer. It has been an
        amazing journey and the ever-changing technologies related to web
        applications fascinates me.
