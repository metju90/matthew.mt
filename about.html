      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Prior to working as a software engineer I used to work as croupier in
        two Maltese casinos. Dealing games such as roulette, blackjack and at
        later stages Texas hold 'em poker too. After 4 years, at the age of 22,
        I realized that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I
        started to ask myself what else I could do in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being my extended family's uncertified but effective PC technician, I
        did know the basics of computers at around the age of 12. I knew what
        RAM, CPU and hard disk were and why a computer may be performing slow. I
        also knew that if your Ethernet cable was unplugged that may be the
        reason for not having internet connection. Ohh, and I certainly knew how
        to format hard disks! That was my solution to any janky PC performance
        problems. It worked most of the time. When it didn't, I told my clients
        to go to a real technician :)
      </p>
      <p>
        I started to explore in which field I could see myself working as one.
        That was the time when I started googling "programming languages" and
        "software development".  Java was the first programming languages I came
        across with. I found a tutorial on how to build a hello world
        application and fell in love with it. I got excited, I was doing
        something new and I was loving it! In 2012 I started to read
        International diploma in computing. After graduating I started reading
        for BSc. in Computer Science(System Engineering) in 2013. The degree
        focused on system engineering than the fundamentals of computer science
        but at that time I believed it was sufficient to land me my dream job -
        working as a Java developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        While studying for a bachelor degree, at the end of the year 2014 I was
        offered a working opportunity as a full stack developer. Working with
        PHP and frontend technologies. It wasn't exactly my ambition to work as
        a software developer if I was not using Java as a programming language
        but I saw this as a great opportunity to start and accepted the offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forwarding to today - I never looked back. I've spent amazing
        {years dynamic} years working as a professional fullstack developer. It
        has been an amazing journey and the ever-changing technologies related
        to web applications fascinates me.
